He also established a scholarship program for a high school in Markham, which brings in professionals each semester to mentor students and provides scholarships to those pursuing higher education. His work with the high school, along with his wife's career as a teacher, has given him firsthand insight into the challenges educators face. He is committed to supporting teachers and improving Ontario's education system.",

His experience motivates him to advocate for policies that strengthen healthcare services and support both patients and providers.",
      "His academic and professional journey has given him a strong understanding of the challenges and opportunities in today's policy landscape. He has a proven track record in public speaking and negotiation, winning the Dentons Canada Negotiation Competition in 2018 and representing Osgoode Hall as a finalist at the Canadian National Negotiation Competition. He also aspires to return to Osgoode Hall as an associate professor to help train the next generation of lawyers.",
      "Outside of law, he has volunteered extensively, coaching sports, participating in legal aid initiatives, and working with ecological science labs.",
      "With a diverse background in law, energy, business, education, and healthcare, Jagbir is well-positioned to represent the Markham-Unionville community."

    quotes: [
      "My legal career began as an energy lawyer when Doug Ford first came into power, and I witnessed firsthand his reckless cancellation of renewable energy contracts, costing ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars. It was a short-sighted decision that set Ontario back‚Äîone we're now paying for as we face an energy shortage. That same pattern of cuts and neglect has played out across healthcare, education, and housing, leaving our communities struggling.",
      "Markham deserves leadership that invests in the future. I'm running to fight for strong public healthcare, properly funded schools, and a real plan for economic growth that puts people first."
